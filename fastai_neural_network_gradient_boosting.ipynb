this case is Response, y_block represents the type of problem.\n\nLastly we have the splits argument which was defined above and represents the dataset split.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"to = TabularPandas(train_df, procs=[Categorify, FillMissing,Normalize],\n                   cat_names = cat_names,\n                   cont_names =
